# Semester Project Final

Q: What changes have been made since the last assignment?

A: Here's a list:

1. Made the upgrades have a clear purpose. They use a multiplier to multiply the number of coins you get per run
2. Fixed a glitch where no coins or upgrades would be displayed when you first start the game
3. Disabled screen rotation. After considering the pros and cons, I decided to not allow rotation on the screen.
4. Fixed the story menu. It now displays properly
5. Added in a few measures to ensure that integer overflow cannot occur with the coins or upgrades
6. Added a win condition. When you click on the "Buy Shoes" Button, you win the game

6.1. Changed the number of coins required to win the game from 10,000 to 1,000,000

6.2. Fixed some glitches that would crash the game whenever the victory screen was shown

7. Minor adjustments to the interface, like rearranging some controls and making sure text and buttons were properly aligned 




Q: What is working? What isn't working?
