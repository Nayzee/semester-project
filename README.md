Q: What data is the application saving and loading?

  A: Currently, it is only save and loading the number of coins that a player may collect in the game. Since there is currently no    gampelay functionality, the game simply adds an amount of coins automatically when the user clicks "start"


Q: What data storage method you are using (Key-Value, Files, Database)?

  A: For now I am using a simple file to store the data. That may change in the future when other functionality is added to the app.


Q: Where in your application you are saving and loading?
  
  A: Since loading and saving are only being done on coins, the saving and loading is currently happening in the results activity. This is also subject to change in the future.
