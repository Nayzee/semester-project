# semester project

Q: What changes have been made since the last assignment?

A: Here's a list:

1. Added Spanish as a second language on the app. All text and buttons should be displayed in Spanish when the sp locale is used.
2. Added the story of the game.
3. Fixed a glitch in the menu that sometimes prevented the user from going back to the main menu from the story or settings menus.
4. Fixed file saving and loading. Coins should now count and be displayed in the way that they are intended.
5. Instead of using a text file to save data, the app now uses a sharedpreferences file with key-values
6. Added upgrades. Now users can use their coins to buy upgrades. They currently don't do anything, but in the future they will allow the user to earn more coins. For now though, the app still keeps track of how many the user has purchased.
7. Made the settings menu fully functional. The "Clear Game Progress" button works as intended.
8. Removed the High Scores page. Since the game does not keep track of score, I felt that high scores were unnessesary, so they have been cut from the game.

Q: What changes do you have planned for the future?

A: Here's another list. More stuff may be added later:

1. Fix the story menu. The story's text is too small when using the app, but to big when editing the app in layout view.
2. Give the upgrades a purpose.
3. Make the game more interesting to play.
