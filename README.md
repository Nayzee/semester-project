What data is the application saving and loading?

Currently, it is only save and loading the number of coins that a player may collect in the game. Since there is currently no gampelay functionality, the game simply adds an amount of coins automatically when the user clicks "start"


What data storage method you are using (Key-Value, Files, Database)?

For now I am using a simple file to store the data. That may change in the future when other functionality is added to the app.

Where in your application you are saving and loading/
Since loading and saving are only being done on coins, the saving and loading is currently happening in the results activity. This is also subject to change in the future.
